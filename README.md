## Learning Experience
Whenever I clone a repot, I see these __tests__ folders not knowing what they are for. After being introduced to TDD, now I know. For my Rojo project, I have to come up with a function that takes questions as an arguement and returns an answer depending on key words such as 'what', 'who', 'where', etc. Before I got working on this function, I came up with different scenarios such as checking if the question arguement has a question mark. If it's not returning the answer I want I go back to my function to make necessary changes. I certainly see the benefits of using this methods and I would like to look into it more.

## To use:
```sh
npm i
npm test
```
